MY CONTRACT

As I go through the CareerHack Program, I hope to learn more about:
//how to develop new skills to learn new languages 
//learn to grow as an individual during this academic experience
//becoming vulnerable in my concerns and asking for help when needed

Some challenges I may face are:
//time managing study blocks 
//google black holes
//picking a virtual background for zoom

To deal with these challenges I plan to:
//providing time blocks
//understanding what needs to be found and applying that to search skills
//pick one and move on

During the program, I commit to putting time aside for myself, because I want to achieve my goal of:
//becoming more paitient with myself
//remember that I am enough
//the struggle is what ispires my success
